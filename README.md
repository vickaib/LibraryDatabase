# LibraryDatabase

## Description
Demo project for superclasses and subclasses. The program is a simple library database where looking up the title of a known novel will display its information.

## Challenges
- Make searching for novel titles more user-friendly, like allowing the user to search for another title, "No Title Found" error messages
- Recommended titles based on search suggestions that don't match stored titles.
- Use API to pull image titles and descriptions online rather than info.txt file
